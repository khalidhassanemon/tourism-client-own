# Getting Started with Tourism

This project was bootstrapped with `ReactJs`, `Tailwind component CSS`, `React router DOM`, `Context API` & later hosted the API in `Vercel` server and finally hosted tha app in firebase successfully. Moreoverly,

1. ** I have included Firbase Google Auth Provider as Authentication services for user login along with general Sign in.**
2. ** Private Routes prevent access through some routes, and access is only permitted after authentication.**
3. ** All of the data are dynamically displayed and collected from the API using Id in the services route. **
4.  ** User will get error if the login information doesn't match with authentication provider. **
5. ** User will get error if the login information doesn't match with authentication provider. **
